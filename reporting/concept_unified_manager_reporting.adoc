Active IQ Unified Manager (formerly OnCommand Unified Manager) provides the ability to view, customize, download, and schedule reports for your ONTAP storage systems. The reports can provide details about the storage system capacity, health, performance, and protection relationships.

The new Unified Manager reporting and scheduling functionality introduced in Active IQ Unified Manager 9.6 replaces the previous reporting engine that was retired in Unified Manager version 9.5.

Reporting provides different views of your network, offering actionable intelligence on capacity, health, performance, and protection data. You can customize your views by showing, hiding, and rearranging columns, filtering data, sorting data, and searching the results. You can save custom views for reuse, download them as reports, and schedule them as recurring reports to distribute through email.

Starting in Active IQ Unified Manager 9.8, you can download views in MicrosoftÂ® Excel format and customize them. You can use advanced Excel features, such as complex sorts, layered filters, pivot tables, and charts. When satisfied with the resulting Excel report, you can upload the Excel file for use each time the report is scheduled and shared.
